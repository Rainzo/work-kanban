## Objective

To build an interactive dashboard which would allow both short-term and long-term forecasting for all channels through modelling of the behaviour of GLAMI's main metrics in response to changes in any of these metrics.

### Key result

GLAMI's approach to setting ROI/COS targets, CPC-out and monthly forecasts is structured and based on historical data, mathematical models, and allows real-time simulations.

- **Use cases**:
    - Setting up monthly forecasts for any channel with respect to desired GP that is either anchored on specific COS or free-floating (selection of single/multiple targets)
    - Seasonal adjustments, e.g. Black Friday weeks ROI settings
    - Reinvestment of accumulated GP into further sessions/revenue that can show how much our sessions/revenue will change if we change ROI or/and cpc-out

### Sub OKRs:

1. Model.
    
    [Predictive model](https://www.notion.so/Predictive-model-9f20298fd842452893efbff887e741a4?pvs=21)
    

**Objective**: 

- Building a machine learning model capable of high-probability prediction of value of chosen variable based on other variables' values (Multivariate Regression).

**Key results**: 

1. Model predicts metrics' behaviour in response to changes on a daily or monthly scale with sufficient probability
2. Model respects seasonality 
3. Model is fast enough to be used in interactive dashboard

2.   Dashboard.

**Objective:**

- Making model interactive through Tableau.

**Key results:**

1. Tableau Server Dashboard allows input of 'independent' variable/s which then shows the outcome for 'dependent' ones
2. Results are plotted in multiple different graphs
