Hey everyone, guys from DEV prepared new column in Tableau - TagExclude. [@slava](https://glami.slack.com/team/UK3G1AEP3) could you please create list of excluded brands in TBL. Then i can imagine we will export it to sheet and start working on what should stay and what should be removed.

Thank you.
