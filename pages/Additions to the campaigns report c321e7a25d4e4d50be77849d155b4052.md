1. We would love to have line charts to see metrics day by day to see changes: ROI, COS, Revenue, Cost, Sessions, Cpc-in/out.
2. More metrics in the report: Can we add GP, CTR, CPM, and Impressions to the report?
3. Can we add a comparison to the report to see the changes with the previous period for the chosen days?
