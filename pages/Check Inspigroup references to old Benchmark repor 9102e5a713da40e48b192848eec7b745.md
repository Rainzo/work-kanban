check if inspigroup taken rows are correctly referenced

[This](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NnTni20EqugFq_Kp7vslmhMjKW4eLZWLB7zG6lvzAsI/edit#gid=0) is hooked up to Tableau.

It takes data from:

- [that](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nye81iFgSMs083Kt74XxTzxmyey0U-oAeyRkhg8HQCE/edit#gid=0) (which is delivered by Norms monthly transformation and written through google sheets writer)
- and Inspigroup Report (tab Database)
- [x]  IT from 06.22 is called IT_GLAMI in Database column of Inspigroup. This name should be maintained so that Glami norms can take data from Inspi. But it screws the connection between Glami norms and Norms (because it should be just IT) -> I rewritten vlookup formula so that all connections work.
- [x]  IT was missing in the Norms transformation because all mobile tables were not extracted since the merge (i.e. not extracted at all). Fixed that
