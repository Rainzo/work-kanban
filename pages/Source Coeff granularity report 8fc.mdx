Priority: high

**Business value:**

- We need a place where we could see actual average source coeff (WCM) per source on a GEO, compared to global default value of source coeff
- We need that to be able to see what the overall actual source coeff is, there is no other place to see it
- We also need to understand WCM on category and provider level for certain periods, there is no other place for us to see it

**Keboola:**

- Table in Keboola: SourceCpcCoefficientDataProviderLog
- ExitLogMetaData?

**Columns:**

- **Avg Source coeff** - WCM on given granularity - 2.76
- **Global Source coeff (last day of period)** - from Klarka settings at last day of period
- **Global Source coeff (avg for period)** - avg across days (noit edits, because we dont have history table)

**Exit-level:**

- Exit 1: google_search, DP SC (data provider source coeff) = 3
    - (G SC google search = 1)
- Exit 2: facebook_cpc, G SC = 2
- Difference between two columns
    - Avg Source coeff - WCM on given granularity: =(3+2)/2=2.5
    - Global Source coeff (avg for period): = (1+2)=1.5

**Task:**

- All Source coeff (actual avg) are weighted by exits, just like WCM

**Tab 1) Source coeff per source**

- Lines: Sources
- Columns:
    - Source coeff (actual avg) (wcm)
    - Source coeff (global - settings)
- Filters: GEO

**Tab 2) Source coeff per shop**

- Lines: Shops
- Columns:
    - Source coeff (actual avg)
- Filters: GEO

**Tab 3) Source coeff per category**

- Lines: Categories
- Columns:
    - Source coeff (actual avg)
- Filters: GEO

**Tab 4) Source coeff per GEO**

- Lines: GEOs
- Columns:
    - Source coeff (actual avg)
