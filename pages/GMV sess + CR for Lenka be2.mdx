- And as a first report in it, I’m wondering if we could see **GMV/session** and **ecommerce exit** rate progress in time. With a filter to select one of the other metric (or both) and another filter for GEO and one for the source (e.g. direct). I would like to monitor these two metrics with the catalog team and the only place I found GMV/session is this [report](https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/Marketingdaily/MarketingreportbyGEOsanddate_1/364103da-24ee-4a7e-9ff0-2913afc333b3/Elika?:iid=1) which does not show its development in time so well. Would this be possible?

It’s not super urgent, but if you found the time to do it sometime next week, it would be great :)
