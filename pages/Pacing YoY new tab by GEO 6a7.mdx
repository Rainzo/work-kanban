**Specification:**

- Please create one more tab to this worksheet: [https://tableau.glami.info/#/workbooks/322/views](https://tableau.glami.info/#/workbooks/322/views)
- It will be similar to this report: [https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/AbitrageMonthly/PacingYoYAllMetrics](https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/AbitrageMonthly/PacingYoYAllMetrics)
- But with slightly different setup:
    - **Instead of countries, there would be channel groups.** So instead of the 14 stable graphs for 14 countries, there would be ~25 stable graphs for ~25 channels.
        - Which channel to use? There is 40 different channels in the channel filter. We don’t wanna use all of them, that would be too many graphs.
        - So please group all of these following channels under “Other” graph: App, Email, Facebook Boosting, Facebook Organic, YT, G pMax, GCO, Instagram, MGID, other ref, Other, Paid Promo, Strossle Native Ads, Taboola, Google Ads YT, Pinterest Ads Prosp, Pinterest Ads RMKT
        - Please sort the graphs by Revenu - i.e. the channel with highest Reve would be firt (in left right corner). If it is difficult to make this sorting dyamic, you can make it static based on Revenue from June 2023.
    - **Instead of channel filter, there will be GEO filter.**
    - Otherwise the two reports are basically the same.

**Why this tab**

- The idea is that it willI be helpful to filter just one GEO and some metric, e.g. GP, and see which channels are driving it down or up. It would be helpful for CMs and for country analysis.
- We dont have any comparable view now. [Country dashboard](https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/Countrydashboarddemo/Countrydashboard/cfb4ea3d-19fa-4a71-88e8-94f06c40eb8a/CZ?:iid=2) doesnt have such view. I checked it with Igor and Zuzka and they would really appreciate it.
- The original report is more helpful for channel owners rather then country owners.
