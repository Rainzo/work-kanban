**Why:**

- For anyone at GLAMI to understand how we are doing in terms of the season target → therefore understand whether we are on track to receive bonus

**Description:**

- Two metrics: Revenues and GP
- For November and December combined
- Both metrics will add together two things:
    - 1) the usual numbers for all GEOs combined (except Italy), for example from from ALL GLAMI dashboard
    - 2) revenues and GP from Black Friday packages (probably Ewelina has a sheet somewhere where she tracks it that you can use)
- For both metrics we want:
    - Actuals - thee will be 0 until 31.10., and will start groing from 1.11.
    - Target
    - Pacing - similar as what we have on GLAMI ALL
