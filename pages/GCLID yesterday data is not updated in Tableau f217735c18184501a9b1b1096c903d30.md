Status: Done
Software: keboola
Engineer: Slava Gatin
Estimation: up to 4 hours
Priority: high

Some geosâ€™ AdwordsGclid / ExitLogGclid tables are populated with latest data after keboola mysql extracts. As a result, almost every day there are several geos with missing google_cpc traffic in Tableau reports. 

1. Try to ensure GCLID data in the afternoon by running add. extractors together with secondary orchestration
2. devs moving their morning crons to map data earlier
