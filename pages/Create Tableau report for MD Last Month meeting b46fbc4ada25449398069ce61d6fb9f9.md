In MD team we regularly create these types of charts:

- numbers of forecasted active providers/real number of active providers/new providers/churned providers per GEO
- until now, these were created manually, taking quite a lot of time so we would like to see an automated solution and reports available anytime
- Ideally we would like to see two reports, because this will be presented during meetings, for better visibility it should look similarly to this:
