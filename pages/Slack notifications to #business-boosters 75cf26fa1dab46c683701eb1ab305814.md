Priority: high

**Why**

- We want to flag some unusual extreme development of certain key metrics to make sure that everyone in #business-boosters channel knows about it
- Relevant owners of metrics can then react on it with explanation and steps

**Basic info**

- Please create new daily Slack notification from Tableau to Slack channel #business-boosters
- The notification will be send only if the rules for any of the metric are met. So even though the check is done daily, it doesn’t mean that the notification will be sent every day, only if the rules are met (e.g. some drop happened)

**Metrics & Rules**

- **1) GP Daily**
    - Rule: If WoW change is more than +-20% in any active GEO, sent notification
- **2) Revenue Daily**
    - Rule: If WoW change is more than +-20% in any active GEO, sent notification
- **3) COS Daily**
    - Rule: If DoD change is more than +-20% in any active GEO, sent notification

    - Rule: If WoW change is more than +-20% in any active GEO, sent notification
- **5) Arbitrage ROI Daily**

    - Which channels to check: Only the five biggest channel groups as defined in [WBR report](https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/GeosBenchmark_16735197591740/WeeklyBusinessReview?:iid=1), that is Search, Display, RMKT, Social Paid, CSS
- Explanation: When we use WoW change for Daily metric, it means comparing this Saturday’s number to previous Saturday’s number
