Report in question is this one:
[https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/CUCBWReporting/Perproviderstats?:iid=2](https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/CUCBWReporting/Perproviderstats?:iid=2)

We would like to add(all sheets):

- documentation
    - timestamp of last update
    - which data is missing (Bartek is the creator of the report, so he might help with that)
    - add descriptions on how it works so it is apparent to everyone using it how all sheets work

We would like to add (sheet in URL above):

- split provider name and provider id (separate columns)
- filter for provider name
