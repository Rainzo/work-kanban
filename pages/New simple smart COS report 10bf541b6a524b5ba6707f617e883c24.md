Please create a new report in Tableau called "Smart COS: Number of providers". It will be in the “Smart COS” section.

Lines

- GEOs

Columns

- "Guarantee offered"
    - shows number of providers who were offered the Smart COS guarantee in a GEO
    - those providers are defined by “SmartCOS” being set in “business program” parameter in DataProvider table
- "Guarantee taken"
    - shows number of providers who actually took the Smart COS guarantee in a GEO
    - those providers are defined by having set a COS target for Smart COS, that means they have "cos" value in table "DataProviderSmartCos"
- Average COS target

- average COS target that the shops have chosen

- average CSO target = sum of cos / number of providers. Taken from table able "DataProviderSmartCos".
