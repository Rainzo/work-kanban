[https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/GlamiItemLikes/Likesmonthly?:iid=1](https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/GlamiItemLikes/Likesmonthly?:iid=1)i found and modified this old report, you can find total users, signed users and their proportion in Likes monthly and Likes daily tabs. Related graphs are below the tables with their own controls. Country and product filters are applicable to both tables and graphs tho

also - just a note - logged in users are applicable only for product = web. I guess for apps there was/is no such thing

as for GMV/user - this will have to be added probably to the same report to tabs GMV per liking user. Currently there is data only for May 2021 and for only users with likes.

- I can update it and include more months to the dataset or
- I can do that AND also expand it to include all users

Both ways it’s a bigger task so i will add it to the board once we decide upon that.

Eventually we can even include both GMV/user and signed users to your Product report

Hello Slava, thank you very much for this, the old report is useful and if we can add in the future app, it would be perfect

As for GMV/user it would be great to have as well, I understand it will take time, that is fine

In the future it would be anyhow needed due to the sunset of GA360. And if then I can have those reports in product folder it would be great
