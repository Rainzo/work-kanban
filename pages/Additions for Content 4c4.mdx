Estimation: up to 4 hours

I was wondering if it would be possible to add a few more things to two Tableau reports that we are using regularly in Content (Content dash and Magazine report) that would be very useful to our reporting overviews. I also discussed it with Lenka last week and she was ok with it as well.

[Content dashboard](https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/ContentDashboard/ContentDashboard?:iid=1)

- Having a comparison view for Organic Sessions and Revenue data for all geos for the current/selected month vs. previous year and previous month data, the change YoY and MoM, and FC pacing.

How it would look like: examples for Dec and Nov [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16CSck5OPJAwLTKJrK10eX0MBlBhBIsGChs-OKC40LJU/edit#gid=1715277089) Ideally, we would have it in a new tab, if possible

- Having a comparison view by page-type for each geo for the current/selected month vs. previous year or previous month, the change YoY or MoM. If possible, it would be good to have the country selection (dropdown list or however it is easier) on the side, with the possibility to select only one geo or multiple/all. Also for the YoY or MoM selection we could have a box for Date on the side.

It would include data from GA - Behaviour - Site Content - Landing pages (segment: Organic Traffic) - Content grouping by page-typeExamples: [CZ Dec 22 YoY](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-landing-pages/a43713201w73809618p76214327/_u.date00=20221201&_u.date01=20221231&_u.date10=20211201&_u.date11=20211231&explorer-segmentExplorer.segmentId=analytics.landingPageGroup1&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&_.useg=builtin5/), [CZ Dec 22 MoM](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-landing-pages/a43713201w73809618p76214327/_u.date00=20221201&_u.date01=20221231&_u.date10=20221101&_u.date11=20221130&explorer-segmentExplorer.segmentId=analytics.landingPageGroup1&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&_.useg=builtin5)Ideally, we would have it in a new tab, if possible

[Magazine](https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/Magazine/Magazine?:iid=3)

- Having a MoM comparison view in the ‘Pageviews by segment’ section (‘Magazine’ tab). I attached the screenshot ‘Magazine_MoM pageviews’ as an example of how it would look like.

I’d be happy to hear your thoughts on whether these additions would be possible and make sense. If needed, I can try to explain something better.As for time, for example if we could have it sometime during February, that would be great, as we could already use it for reporting from the beginning of March.
