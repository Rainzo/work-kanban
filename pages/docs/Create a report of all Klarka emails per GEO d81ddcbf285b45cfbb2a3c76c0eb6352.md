The table should look like this:

It basically surfaces all email addresses and their types + relation to a data provider. This would allow us to test out new HubSpot feature. 

Matej's note: I tried creating this myself but was not sure how to connect all email addresses (which are in table hubspot_contact_props) with data provider IDs, since in the the hubspot_contact_props there is no data provider ID, only associated company ID from HubSpot
