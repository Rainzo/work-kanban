As discussed on the meeting, we would like to build custom reporting on HubSpot Deals from Account Management Pipeline in Tableau/Holistics. 

First step would be to create a connection from HubSpot to Keboola and decide which BI tool to use for this task.

**Next steps from kick-off meeting:**

- Verify if deals data is available in keboola (BI team)
- Get the number representation for deal stages and pipelines (in keboola they do not have full names, just numbers) @Matej Višňovský

**Goal:**
Build automated reporting for every deal type with level of detail based on manual analysis done [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xzCaJD4TP2ieGcG2yXNOrC7DEgt0XLHeVRmM6WB0S3k/edit#gid=1935536993).

**Requirements:**

- Create a dashboard for every deal type from AMP (list to be delivered)
    - dashboard should contain the level of detail and calculations covered [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xzCaJD4TP2ieGcG2yXNOrC7DEgt0XLHeVRmM6WB0S3k/edit#gid=1935536993)

**Open questions:**
Is it possible to analyse deal stage history based on data available? Explanation: We’d like to know how many deals that reached Won stage also reached Negotiation/Pitching prior to that.

**Notes:**
@Michal Smrčina I heard back from HubSpot about deal stages and pipeline names represented as numbers:

- Those deal pipelines and stages can be retrieved through the API as well. You can find documentation on the calls to be made here: [https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/crm/pipelines](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/crm/pipelines)
    - probably here in KBC [https://connection.keboola.com/admin/projects/1828/storage/in.c-kds-team-ex-hubspot-crm-869901277/deals#data-sample](https://connection.keboola.com/admin/projects/1828/storage/in.c-kds-team-ex-hubspot-crm-869901277/deals#data-sample)
- "label" will be the name of the pipeline or stage that is returned while "id" will be the numeric value you are seeing in the deal export.
    - looks ok here in KBC [https://connection.keboola.com/admin/projects/1828/storage/in.c-kds-team-ex-hubspot-crm-869901277/pipeline_stages#data-sample](https://connection.keboola.com/admin/projects/1828/storage/in.c-kds-team-ex-hubspot-crm-869901277/pipeline_stages#data-sample)

**Progress:**

- ~~Table ***deals*** → column ***dealstage*** (numeric id) can be probably connected to ***stageId*** from table ***pipeline_stages**.*~~
- “**hubspot_team_id**” is only numeric and possibly dont have any translation in HS properties - manually afterwards?
- Aggregated [**KBC table**](https://connection.keboola.com/admin/projects/1828/storage/in.c-main_proc/hs_deals_amp_overview#data-sample) consists of joined extracts from objects *deals*, *pipeline_stages*, *pipelines*, *owners*. Object *companies* probably not needed

New tables in KBC, already pushed to Tableau

- hs_deals_amp_overview
- hs_deals_amp_history
-
