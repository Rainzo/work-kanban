We want to create a report that will allow us see how retained are users that finished the quiz in following weeks and months from that event.

- The report should be a table with cohorts based on time grouping when the event occurred. For example users that finished the quiz in a week 9.5.-15.5.2022 will have its cohort. Similar to monthly cohorts.
- Cohort behavior will be reflecting selected cohort time grouping logic. For example weekly cohorts will have 1st, 2nd, 3rd week, .. columns

**Report should allow us to:**

- Filter based on values:
    - Number of visits per user
    - Percentage of users with at least one visit
    - GMV per user in currency
    - Revenue per user in currency
    - Number of exits per user
    - Number of likes per user
- Filter based on GEOs
- Filter based on time
- Change cohort time grouping types:
    - Week
    - Month
- Change cohort type based on type of event
    - Quiz done (record in QuizDone table)
    - Quiz done and registered/logged in (record in QuizDone table with userid)
