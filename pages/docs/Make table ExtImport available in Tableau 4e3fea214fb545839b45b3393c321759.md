DEV finished a task of making table ExtImport available to BI team in Keboola. We would like to see this table in Tableau too, so that we can use it for further processes on BEX side.

We agreed with Slava that it can be directly scheduled to run in writers. We will then join data from this table to existing data in data_provider table ourselves.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
