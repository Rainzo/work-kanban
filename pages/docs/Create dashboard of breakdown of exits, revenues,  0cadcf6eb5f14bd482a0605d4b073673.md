Connected to Midmarket, we would like to see an overview dashboard/table of KPIs breakdown per GEO and per Shoptype, example below:

GEO: CZ

The idea is to create columns: % of total exits, number of exits, % of revenues, revenues, % of GMV, GMV, % of total shops, number of shops

Add filters: 

- GEO
- provider status
