Hi Slava once again today. I was talking about some changes strongly connected and affecting share of free exits today with CMs and our new CEO and we have one question.

Is it possible to add one more filter into this view:

[https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/Freevs_paid/DashFreeexitsbyprovider?:iid=2](https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/Freevs_paid/DashFreeexitsbyprovider?:iid=2)

We would like to filter between exits from reccuring traffic (organic/direct sources - free traffic) and arbitrage (cpc, display etc… - paid traffic).

Is it possible? Do you have there source of the data for this filter?
