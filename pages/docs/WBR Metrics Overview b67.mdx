**What and why:**

- “WBR” = Weekly Bussines Review” - this should be a new meeting for management where to go through most important metrics and do executive decision making
- This report is preparation for the metric overview
- Inspiration for report: This benchmarking report is similar in principle, maybe we can even start by duplicating this one and building on that, I’m not sure.

    - [https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/Countrybenchmarkcomparison/Countrybenchmarkcomparison?:iid=1](https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/Countrybenchmarkcomparison/Countrybenchmarkcomparison?:iid=1)

**Lines:**

- Metrics structure into 6 sections, according to this Notion table (column “Area”): [https://www.notion.so/glami/WBR-Metrics-Overview-af5afa18cee947efa76f447549af1732](https://www.notion.so/WBR-Metrics-Overview-af5afa18cee947efa76f447549af1732?pvs=21)
- In column “Source of data” I hint where ti get the metrics or what are we looking for

**Columns:**

- **Metrics**
- **Type of Metric**
- **Owner**
- Actual values of metrics - values should be either green or red, depending on comparison to previous period (if they grew → green, it they decreased → red)
    - **All GEOs** - number for all GEOs combined
    - **One column for each GEO**
- (similar as it is in the GSheet as well, the numbers in Gsheet are just examples)

**Filters:**

- **Period**
    - Ideally you could select any period past period, by default last 7 days is selected
    - But the most important for us at the start is Last 7 days, so if we need to simplify, lets start there?
- **Currency**
    - Ideally in the future we can switch between CZK and EUR, but we can simplify and start with CZK for the whole report
