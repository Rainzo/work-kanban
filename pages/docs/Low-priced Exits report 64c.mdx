Owner: Tibor Kese
Status: Done
Engineer: Matej Višňovský
Estimation: up to 2 hours
Priority: high

**Business value:**

- We have 0,7% - 2.3% of exits priced extremely low
- We need current overview of how much it is per GEO, to be able to understand the scale of a problem in GEOs

**Filters:**

- GEO
- Timeframe
- CPC limit
- AutoCOS - yes or no

Context from Tibor:
We can simply be able to filter out a GEO, timeframe and CPC limit. We do not have to create this as a percentage of an average, but simply just count the number of exits that are below the set threshold.

Additional feature - to have the ability to drill down on the low priced exits and see the whole list (filtering can be done based on an export of this by CMs, who will mainly use these reports)
