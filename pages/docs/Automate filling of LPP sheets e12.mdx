- **What we want**
    - Start automatically updating sheets that we
- **How it works today**
    - We use these sheets for monitoring of LPP performance based on their attribution - [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17LC4VcCbRomJd9YYZtoODiB7oIPHmNe3WhexNruPTt8/edit#gid=610747106](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17LC4VcCbRomJd9YYZtoODiB7oIPHmNe3WhexNruPTt8/edit#gid=610747106)
    - The Costs part here - [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17LC4VcCbRomJd9YYZtoODiB7oIPHmNe3WhexNruPTt8/edit#gid=1550730849](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17LC4VcCbRomJd9YYZtoODiB7oIPHmNe3WhexNruPTt8/edit#gid=1550730849) - is manually updated every week by Elena Kaltykova
    - It is simply daily data about Exits, CPC and Revenue for a particular shop
- **How it can work with new report**
    - I think we can create similar tables in Holistics
    - And then export the data daily to this Google Sheets
    - Then Elena doesnt need to manually update it
