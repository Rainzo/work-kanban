Hey, can I request additional filtering for

[this](https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/AvgCPCShopBreakDown-SamevsNewvsLost/ListsofLostshops?:iid=5) report? I am currently looking at the “Lost shops” tab and for me it would make sense to have a filter for maximum days on paid.E.g. - the shop [Mania.bg](http://mania.bg/) was on paid during the first period and not on paid during the second. So we go after them for regain priority. However [Mania.bg](http://mania.bg/) do not appear on the list because they had  3 days on paid during the second period. But this was back in January - long time ago and not been paid ever since.

I consider them important to go after. There will be other shops with the same situation that we will miss.So it will be good if I can choose the same dates for Period 1 and 2 + another filter to also show shops that were on paid for maximum of 3/4/5 days for example during the second period and still see them in the list with this filter. Now we cannot see them.Let me know if it does not make sense I can further explain better maybe. Or it is not achievable for some reason.
