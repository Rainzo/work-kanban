Hello guys, how are you ? We made bigger change in autocos calculation and I need some help to track it, can you please just update [https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/eCPCWoWbyprovidersandcategories/eCPCbyproviders?:iid=1](https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/eCPCWoWbyprovidersandcategories/eCPCbyproviders?:iid=1) report in same format, just change eCPC to real CPC and add columns by days (last 7) and add filter for autocos shops (because change is applied only on those) Thank you ! If you will be able to extend it on Categories within providers in separate tab, it will be even more amazing.

Or even better to extend to do %dod change for this one [https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/ChannelsandCategories/Categories?:iid=1](https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/ChannelsandCategories/Categories?:iid=1) we have there cpc and other kpis will be useful, but missing categories in providers
