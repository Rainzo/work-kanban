Tugce:

Rows : ad groups which have min 20 transactions + which campaign they belong to

Columns: Exits, CR%, Avg cpc out, ROI, COS, GMV, Shop CR%, Orders, CR%

filters: country, device, provider

****only paid providers can be on the list.

date range: last 7days automatically - current day is excluded - but would be nice if we can have a slider for custom dates or a calender would be nice
