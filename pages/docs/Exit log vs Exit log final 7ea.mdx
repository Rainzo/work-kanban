Hi Slava
I need to compare monthly data from tables: exitlog exitlog final
these two tables should be shared in Tableau alreadyâ€¦exitlog contains all exitsexitlog final is without duplicities - final exits we are reporting and also charging our partners
**Can you please prepare simple data where:**

- first row will be monthly number of total exits (exitlog)
- second row will be monthly number of cleared exits - without duplicities (exitlog Final)
- third row will be monthly difference => what is missing in exitlog
- Finalfourth row will be: share of duplicate exits from all : third row divided by first row

I would like to filter per country. I need to see mainly 2021 monthly and also continue monitoring current year - so basically monthly view.
