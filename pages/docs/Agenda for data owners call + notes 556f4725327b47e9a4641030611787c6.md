*Chapter leaders call*:

- Expectations, ideas for cross-teams alignment
(to then add to chapter responsibilities)
- Align about what will be the responsibilities of data owners
- Ideas for reports:
    
    1) Report for peaks in categories, filters, products, searches (TH idea, [inspired by Google](https://searchengineland.com/new-google-rising-retail-categories-tool-exposes-fast-growing-product-searches-334359))
    
    2) ...
    

*Data owners call:*

- Most used reports within chapters
(Data owners should prepare a list of reports that their teams use **before** the call)
- Workflow for the requests:
    
    1) requests should come from data owners once reports are defined within chapters
    
    2) data owners have checked whether needed reports already exist
    
- Validation of data for data owners
(We will make sure data owners have the mechanism to validate the quality of the data themselves)
