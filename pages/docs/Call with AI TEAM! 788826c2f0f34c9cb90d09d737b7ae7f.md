orders in GA and in klarka are very different

Goal in GA / custom metric mess that can be sorted out

ask Jakub for AWS access:

1. training datasets for Merlin
2. sql dumps for Rex (csv compressed and encrypted) - Rex bucket / glami s3 buckets â†’ sql dumps are there + bucket strictly for Rex (models)
3. Gordeon - ga + ppc data
