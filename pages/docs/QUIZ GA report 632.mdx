I would like to request a report for **quiz** where I can see **finished quizzes and quiz registration per campaign**.**Why:** I do it in GA but it takes a lot of time because I need to switch between geos and reports.**Definition** for what campaign should be included: all which contain the word “quiz”I would like to have 10 columns in the report, highlighted ones are the most important:

1. Source
2. **Campaign**
3. Sessions
4. **Finished Quiz**
5. CR from session to finished quiz
6. **Registration**
7. CR from finished quiz to registration
8. Log ins
9. Exit clicks
10. Likes
11. Revenue
12. GMV

Free to discuss in case some of not important metrics will be an extra problem. And if you see them as not important cc [@katia](https://glami.slack.com/team/UMCJ7S61G)

**Filters:**
