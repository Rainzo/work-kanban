**What and why**

- This is supposed to be a second tab in this worksheet, next to WBR Metrics Overview: [https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/GeosBenchmark_16735197591740/WeeklyBusinessReview?:iid=1](https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/GeosBenchmark_16735197591740/WeeklyBusinessReview?:iid=1)
- It should be used when we want to look at one of the metrics in more detail for a deep-dive
- It creates consistency, given that it has the same structure for all of the metrics

**How should it look like**

- There is three parts: Graph Zoom-In, Graph Zoom-Out & Comparison table
- You can see all three parts and how exactly it should look like in GSheet here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DuREVLzN0d7NoP7S9XP3y30vvK_ECz5pqE1Oe3BuFg0/edit#gid=1468003892](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DuREVLzN0d7NoP7S9XP3y30vvK_ECz5pqE1Oe3BuFg0/edit#gid=1468003892)
- It also includes all filters, together with their default values
- In the filter Metric, you should be able to select any metric from the WBR Metrics Overview

**Limitations:**

- YoY comparison not possible for all metrics - I realize that some of the metrics will not be available for such long time-frame, but that is fine. The YoY line would simply not be there.
- Channel filter wonâ€™t be available for all metrics, just for some
