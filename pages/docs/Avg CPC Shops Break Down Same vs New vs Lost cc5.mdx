**INTRO:**

- **Why we do it?**
    - Avg CPC shop is one of the main metrics we use
    - But we dont understand well effects:
        - Split into Same vs New vs Lost
        - Split into {Number of shops} * {Days on Paid}
- **Workbook name:** “Avg CPC Shops Break Down: Same vs New vs Lost”
    - Shows change in Avg CPC shops between two selected periods
    - Splits that change into effect of Same, New, Lost shops
    - Filters: (these should be filters that apply to all three reports below)
        - Period 1: Select time period
        - Period 2: Select time period
- **Underlying data**
    - This report is build on **percentage of Paid&Active days per shop per period**
    - We already have such data in datasets, and many reports are using it, for example this report in Retention: [https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/BDshopretention_16194287488750/Auto-paymentcandidates](https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/BDshopretention_16194287488750/Auto-paymentcandidates)

**REPORTS:**

- **Report 1:** “YoY comparison”
    - Adds Seasonality YoY into it
    - Lines and Columns: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QeuzsHh_X-I6lCRyQboecDD5mCHqeNhokE-A8idKA7Q/edit#gid=1387261000](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QeuzsHh_X-I6lCRyQboecDD5mCHqeNhokE-A8idKA7Q/edit#gid=1387261000)
- **Report 2:** “Number of shops vs Days on Paid”
    - Split of Avg CPC Shops into a product of [Number o shops at least 1 day in the period] * [Days on Paid % in that period]
    - Lines and Columns: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QeuzsHh_X-I6lCRyQboecDD5mCHqeNhokE-A8idKA7Q/edit#gid=1728604928](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QeuzsHh_X-I6lCRyQboecDD5mCHqeNhokE-A8idKA7Q/edit#gid=1728604928)
    - Learning from relative change - Relative effect (positive or negative) of Same, New or Lost shops on overal change in Avg CPC shops. With this you can understand which group of shops had the biggest effect on change in Avg CPC shops.
        - Example: If change in Avg CPC shops was -20%, and Δ% for Same shops is -2%, for New shops is +1%, and for Lost shops is -19%-> You know that Lost shops had by far biggest relative effect, and that Lost shops are the reason why your Avg CPC shops decreased.
    - You can split between number of shops and days on Paid
    - Other learning in sheets
- **Report 3:** “List of shops”
    - Lines: List of all shops from the two selected periods
    - Columns: See here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QeuzsHh_X-I6lCRyQboecDD5mCHqeNhokE-A8idKA7Q/edit#gid=1321315241](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QeuzsHh_X-I6lCRyQboecDD5mCHqeNhokE-A8idKA7Q/edit#gid=1321315241)
    - Filters:
        - Type: Same vs New vs Lost
        - Explanation:
            - The two time periods that you select in time filters define the set of define which shops are Same, New and Lost
            - Same = shops that are both in Period 1 and Period 2
            - New = shops that are in Period 2 and not in Period 1
            - Lost = shops that are in Period 1 but not in Period 2
