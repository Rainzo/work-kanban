[**SHOP STATUS report**](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/1dc270db-d5cd-496e-a242-dfd9db96edbf/page/9fW0B)

This is the second amazing report me & other people  use on daily bases to analyze the status of new, churn, inactive and spare shops.

1st. tab - general graph

2nd tab - inactive shops

3rd tab - churn shops (no clicks > 60 days)

4th tab - new shops - activation and the entry conditions. Very important tab for bonus system as they have acquisition goals.

Can you please have a look at this and if you have any questions feel free to shoot ;)

I will add this task to the merge map and assign us to it.

Take care and we stay in touch.

Ewel.
