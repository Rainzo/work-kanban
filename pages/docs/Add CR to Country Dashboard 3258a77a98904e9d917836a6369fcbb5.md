- "E-commerce CR"
- "vs forecast E-commerce CR"

**Reasoning:**

- We are noticing that we are behind forecast in August on E-commerce CR and Shop CR, but we dont have a good report where to compare the forecasted CRs per channel with actual CRs, and see where we have the biggest problems
- @Slava Gatin Do you know about any marketing Tableau report showng comparisons of CRs per channel to forecast? I havent found any
