Hi guys, any chance we could do something with 2021 data in this report? Since monthly data are aggregated to first day of the month, it is kind of not useful for Italy.I am thinking maybe we could remove the 2021 from the report completely for IT?

Or we can divide it equally for the whole month. That would give us a proper scale at least
