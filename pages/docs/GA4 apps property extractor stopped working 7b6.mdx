Software: keboola
Engineer: Slava Gatin, Michal Smrčina
Estimation: up to 4 hours
Priority: highest

Need to replace it with a new one without transaction metric and also rewrite all transformations where it is used until Keboola / Google fix the extractor / API.

Old Extractor:

New Extractor:

Transformations using apps_data_new → to add new apps’ table:
