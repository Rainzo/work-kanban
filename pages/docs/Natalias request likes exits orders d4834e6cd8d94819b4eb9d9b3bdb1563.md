3. How hard it to make the same table for exits, not orders

[http://91.241.9.59/#/views/Categoriesperformance/Ordersbycategoryorderdate?:iid=1](http://91.241.9.59/#/views/Categoriesperformance/Ordersbycategoryorderdate?:iid=1)

We already have

[this](http://91.241.9.59/#/views/Categoriesperformance/ExitsbycategoryandgeoENG?:iid=1)

but I need it in the format of previous report. In EN. Also a question - in this kind of report we include into jackets category both women and men? If both, could we have some filter men and women? Thank you

Thank you and will be waiting for your comments, we can have a short call if needed :)
