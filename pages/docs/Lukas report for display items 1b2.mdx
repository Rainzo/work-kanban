for the ongoing implementation of ScoutIDs to our marketing channels, I would need to know how many users which have at least 1 exit click have returned back to GLAMI website (with the same Client ID) after 1 day and in the next 14 days after the exit click happened => time span (1 day, 14 days). Additionally, I would need to know how big percentage of them have at least 1 itemID from our partners recorded as a ScoutID (table RemarketingLog2Item). Ideally for every GEO, if too time consuming just CZ and SK.Would it be possible to create such a table?
