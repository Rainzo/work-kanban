May I ask you for a favor? We were having a discussion in our team, that it would be nice to have a visualization of our AWS costs in tableau. A nice example how this might work is here:

[https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2019/3/monitor-aws-cloud-cost-usage-102383](https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2019/3/monitor-aws-cloud-cost-usage-102383)

in order to do that, we would need to add AWS Athena driver in Tableau and connect to s3 storage, where we would save cost and usage report data.
