Priority: low

the final aggregation could be channel, day, category 1-3 at the end

So this table can be use to identify autoCOS providers: "**out.auto_cos_kpis_providers"**

it contains the combination of date, provider and category for autoCOS providers only

So for our case you can aggregate it to get unique combination of provider and date

and then you assign to exit_logs the column autoCOS on provider and date (so all exit logs of given provider and date will be considered asi autoCOS if the are matching the table)

orders have exit_log_id so you can decide about orders by looking at their exit_log
