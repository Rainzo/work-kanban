Can we adjust this [report](https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/BDweeklymonthlyreports/BDmonthlyreport?:iid=1) in order to show older data too? The business question is: We want to see how many new providers were activated and charged credit every month since the beginning on TR.I think this report should answer the question, but the dates are limited to go back only to mid 2021.
