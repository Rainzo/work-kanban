1. We will talk to the AI team and discuss how BI and AI could cooperate and profit from each others work.
2. We also discussed the idea of Open data platform so the data owners would be able to do some quick analysis by themselves. At the moment I cannot imagine something like this. The report map and knowledge base would be the tools which can navigate everyone to the goal. If there is the request for some kind of more detailed and sophisticated analysis it should be always proceed by the BI chapter.
3. Tool comparison aka differences between klarka, Tableau, Data studio, GA. People don't know much what to expect from which tool and what is the purpose of each tool. Which one is the best for a given case/report. Regarding this we agreed with [@slava](https://glami.slack.com/team/UK3G1AEP3) to prepare some article/webinar/meeting to explain it.
4. GA onboarding - general knowledge base. We also agreed with [@slava](https://glami.slack.com/team/UK3G1AEP3) that the BI knowledge base and FAQ's would be very valuable for the company. In terms of this I would sometimes prefer short video tutorial over the "article" or description. The knowledge base could be build in Notion. Also maybe the general Glami knowledge base not only from BI/data field but also PPC, FB ads etc. would be very valuable.
