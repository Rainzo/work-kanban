Hello there, can we please add one more list to

[this report?](https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/AvgCPCShopBreakDown-SamevsNewvsLost/NumberofshopsvsDaysonPaid?:iid=3)

I would like to be able to see all shops by status, that never had any paid exits (were never paid).

Name: Paid History

Columns: ID, shop name, created date in Klarka (the date from klarka on screenshot), status and field that would show if shop ever had any paid exits, something like paid exists: yes/no. It could also be just date of first top up and N/A if there was no top up ever.

Filters: geo, provider status, and for periods based on the created date in Klarka (created before/after). Thanks a lot!
