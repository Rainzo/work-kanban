Priority: low

i would like to ask you to help us with one nice analysis.It is connected to our CSS feeds and performance of the given products sets.Our ([@Harry Spinthakis](https://glami.slack.com/team/UCGDDN30T)) hypothesis is:"Products within shoes categories perform well only if more sizes are available"Do you think you should create report, where we would see:

- performance of CSS traffic on product level - metrics (no of exits, revenues, cpc-out, Shop CR, Shop AOV, Shop GMV)
- group products by no. of available sizes (honesltly i do not know if we even have it or how it works when this is changing in time)
- generel filter only shoes categories (in men, women, kids)
- active filter Country (multiple selection available)
- time period - last month (also could be in filter if possbile, but it is not crucil)

Please let me know if is it even doable and how difficult it would be. Thanks a lot.
