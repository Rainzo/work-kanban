```
- (separate communication) Investigate those suspicious aggregation results on the monthly bases for Total Cos
- Remove final day MSE. (It distracts from the Avg tCos which is the best)
- Remove order weighting on the Total MSE. (To make more comparable with the table and Selected Shop MSE.)
- Add per-geo per-week table and chart on the same or separate dashboard (what is easier)
  - the table will have weeks in the rows based on the selected interval (default to 3 months)
  - the columns will be geos
  - the values will have MSE for that geo for that day excluding shops with less than 14 days in the AutoCos
  - the chart lines will correspond to columns (geos)
