Hey guys, could we please add to Data/BI backlog this task:Please add one column toÂ **[this report](https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/AutoCOSSmartCOSguarantee/AutoCOSKPIs?:iid=5):**

- column called "% of AutoCOS shops"
- = number of AutoCOS shops / Total CPC shops
- no big hurry or priority, but based on feedback would be helpful for country teams to understand how pig portion of providers generates the AutoCOS revenues and exits
