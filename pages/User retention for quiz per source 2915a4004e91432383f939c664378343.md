**To-do:**

Analyze the retention and behaviour of users, who took the quiz from sources

1. fb / fb_page, campaign including the word “boost”
2. referral / influencers, all campaigns
3. Direct source 

What are they doing after, do they come back etc. I guess it will be a cohort 

**Hypotheses to confirm/reject:**

1. For fb / fb_page - because boosting ads are rather intriguing and over-promising, I am concerned users take the quiz out of curiosity and don’t come back after
2. While for source referral / influencers we have a higher price per finished quiz, but influencers explain the concept of the product. People, who take the quiz, could be genuinely interested in the product and have higher retention than the ones who come from boosting.

**To discuss:**

- The request is for these particular sources, but can be expanded for other sources and campaigns inside of these sources?
- “Maybe we need to extend the cohort even for users that didn't finish the quiz. The goal would be to see whether the campaign (both influence and boosting) brings users to GLAMI and they start using it. I know you've already done some revenue per session analysis but the longer view to see retention patterns would be nice”
