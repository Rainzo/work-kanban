@Matej Višňovský @Tibor Kese dev guys have deleted this table from CZ klarka and put it into KG (Klarka general). I’ve set up extractor config but i’m waiting for Vit to validate it, it’s not done yet. Once it’s done this table will be refreshed again. Until then Hubspot inconsistencies report will be using the versions of Hubspot Klarka contacts from August 29, 2022:
