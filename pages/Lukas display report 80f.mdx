I would like to have similar report for display. Basically, I like the layout, metrics and data there, so it is not necessary to create anything completely new. However, there are some small details I would like to change/add/specify:

1. To include channels: Google Ads DN, Google Ads RMKT (Sklik DN and RMKT in CZ), RTB House Remarketing, Criteo Remarketing, RTB House Prospecting, Criteo Prospecting, Taboola.
2. To have “pacing tab” with all channels in it as it is now (SEA & Brand pacing).
3. To have separate WoW/YoY tabs for grouped channels as follows:
4. Google Ads DN and RMKT in one tab with totals summed from these two channels (Sklik DN and RMKT in CZ) from each GEO under it.
5. RTB House Remarketing, Criteo Remarketing in one tab with totals summed from these two channels from each GEO under it.
6. RTB House Prospecting, Criteo Prospecting in one tab with totals summed from these two channels from each GEO under it.
7. To have also Gross Profit, CTR and Shop CR in WoW/YoY tabs.
8. To have Gross Profit pacing in “pacing tab”.
9. To have Totals at the end of “pacing tab”. All channels together. It means that I want to include every display and remarketing channel which we have (pls dont forget on Sklik DN and RMKT and Seznam Banner in CZ)
