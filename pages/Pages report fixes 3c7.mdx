Hello, [this report](https://tableau.glami.info/?qzwavg2em5fyfck6g2kwwmyxaq=w4tbbqfb6bd7vhk6m5oy3obp64#/views/Fbpostreport2_0/FBpostCZnew?:iid=2), two things:

- when I filter by date, I still get posts from different period
- could you please unify the system of the the beahaviour of the links column? Meaning, sometime I have to click on the link and it redirects my to the page on a new tab, but sometimes, there is a tiny "pop-up" where I have to copy the link and paste it manually to the new tab (little bit annoying) – example the CZ report vs. the LT report. ➡️ can we make the column "post_link" make behave the same for all the geos' reports, ideally as CZ report? Thank you!
