### Get the access to DB

Get the infrastructure team to make us access to or create a dedicated (for data analysis/reporting purposes) database server with replication of all geos but probably not all tables + make there one additional db schema with a write access (to create stored views/procedures/user-defined functions)

- [x]  Done

How to get costs from DB?

### Align with marketing about granularity

- Marketing: not needed atm, except for eventually having Orders data earlier.
