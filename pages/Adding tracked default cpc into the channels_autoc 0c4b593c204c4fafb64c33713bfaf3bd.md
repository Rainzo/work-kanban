Priority: high

- BM, Base COS and Base revenue are full data and can’t be calculated with respect to tracked/non-tracked parameter. Adding new fields to the data in keboola, readjusting writers for 1 run to grab all rows.
- Reconnecting autocos_providers_channels datatset from the BQ to add wcm and wpm as decimals and measures again.
