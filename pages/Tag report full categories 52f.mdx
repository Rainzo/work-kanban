Lenka's request to see performance of kids categories and other categories too, similar to **[this](https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/Tagreport/ByEnglishname?:iid=1).**
for full overview we need to use exit_log w/o items or exit_log_aggr (up to 3 levels of categories)

yes, that would be great, in this case, Iâ€™m trying to get all info for the categories that are under that category as well, would that we possible?
