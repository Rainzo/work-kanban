Hey, came along this app notification report: [https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/NotificationsreportAutomaticManual/Automaticnotification_1?%3Aiid=1](https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/NotificationsreportAutomaticManual/Automaticnotification_1?%3Aiid=1)

1. now finally we can attribute revenue to different type of notification in this report but not for all countries, why?
2. no data about revenues etc for March
3. would change the name “transactionRevenue” to “revenue” to avoid confusion because not whole word is seen
4. we are missing GMV, would add it + COS and shop CR% if possible
5. would be nice to have Revenue and GMV in euro
6. “MoM%” as the last row (for all notifications types and all metrics)
7. Set up looks pretty not user friendly, I would play with changing rows to columns or smth like that but I’m not sure about it, more up to you.
