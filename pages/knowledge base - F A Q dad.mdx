- video based
- GA training as explanation, maybe two parts - novice and intermediate
- feed lists
- source / campaign channel grouping segmentation

the explanation of the KPI's so we can agree which one makes sense for you for the analysis.

1. Click can be exit click and also click on product detail
2. Unique view is connected to the guest (visitor) so if one guest displayed the product of the given provider or category 10 times. The total view is 10 and unique is 1.
3. Unique exit clicks are also connected to the guest. Exit rate vs. unique exit rate
4. Exit rate = total exits / total views x Unique exit rate = unique exits / unique views
