We are facing an issue where we do not know if something goes wrong with the XML feed for providers. We would like to set up a notification system (especially for bigger providers) that would alert us when something breaks in a timely manner. 

Here are the examples of what we would like to see:

- total items count in the feed drops by 20%
- Number of missing mandatory parameters (such as item id, product name, price) changes negatively. Meaning is that on day 1 there would be 0 missing parameters, the next day there would be 2.

The first part of this task would be exploratory for the BI team - to find out if they have all necessary data for this task.

After that, we would like to see all providers that are:

- active
- Shoptype = TOP or Middle Size

After that, possibly 2 reports to be created:

**Report 1**

Columns:

- provider ID
- provider name
- isPaid
- total items in the feed (previous day)
- total items in the feed (current day)
- DoD change in %

**Report 2**

Columns:

- provider ID
- provider name
- isPaid
- Count of missing mandatory parameters (previous day)
- Count of missing mandatory parameters (current day)
