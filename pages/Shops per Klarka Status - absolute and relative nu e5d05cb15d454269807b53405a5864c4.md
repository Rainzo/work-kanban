**Business value:**

- We need to catch changes in statuses and anomalies between GEOs fast and be aware of it
- For that we need comparison of absolute and relative numbers on one place

**Task:**

- We already have this report: [https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/AdhocreportsBD-Tibor/Paidxfreebystatus?%3Aiid=1](https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/AdhocreportsBD-Tibor/Paidxfreebystatus?%3Aiid=1)
- New structure similar to this: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bFqHqo5CfqDfIrO_EajRQFIXgGM9DAWg8CgYIau5_Fc/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bFqHqo5CfqDfIrO_EajRQFIXgGM9DAWg8CgYIau5_Fc/edit#gid=0)
- But we need to add comparison per GEO, add percentages
