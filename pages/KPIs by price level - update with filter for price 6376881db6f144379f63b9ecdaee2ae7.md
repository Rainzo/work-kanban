- **We can build on the report created in this task:** [https://www.notion.so/glami/6d2342414cb14ed09c0c49743e59e28c?v=ff24a121c6db44fe88d92616d0962f18&p=c1110c64a9444448a3d5075a89a923a6](KPIs%20by%20price%20level%20-%20update%20with%20filter%20for%20PM%20c1110c64a9444448a3d5075a89a923a6.md)
    - Rows = price ranges
    - Columns = same as in table
    - All current filters stay
- **But the dataset will have to be different**, because this time we will need the price multiplier data from ExitMetaDataLog table
- **Rationale:**
    - This report will serve for recalculation of optimal values of price coeffs **and price ranges**
    - Also, This report will serve for CMs to use regularly and potentially change price multiplicators based on it
- **Create new filter for price range borders - "Range border":**
    - Range border 1
        - Example CZ: 300
    - Range border 2
        - Example CZ: 1000
    - Range border 3
        - Example CZ: 2000
    - Range border 4
        - Example CZ: 3000
    - Set current values by default
    - It should be possible to change the values. When we change value in filter for price range border, then the ranges will change (rows in the table)
        - Example: current range 1 in CZ is 0-300. If we change filter "Range border 1" to 400, that means that new range 1 will be 0-400.
- **Add a new tab**
    - where you would copy the report, but show all the data per category - exactly the same logic as in this report (this was also just a cpy of the furst tab, but showing the data per category) - [https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/KPIsbypricelevel/KPIsbypriceandcategory?:iid=1](https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/KPIsbypricelevel/KPIsbypriceandcategory?:iid=1)
