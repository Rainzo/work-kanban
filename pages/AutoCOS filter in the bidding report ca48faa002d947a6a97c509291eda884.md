Ciao guys,could you please add to backlog the following?

- Please add filter "AutoCOS" to this report - [https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/Revenuebyprovidersbidding/Revenuebyprovidersbiddinghistory?:iid=1](https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/Revenuebyprovidersbidding/Revenuebyprovidersbiddinghistory?:iid=1)
- It came be similar filter as for example here (see screenshot) - [https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/ChannelsandCategories/Channels?:iid=1](https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/ChannelsandCategories/Channels?:iid=1)

The goal is to be able to identify providers that are actually bidding above default CPC (either in admin or through feed).I dont think we have a report where I can find this out.The solution above would solve it I think.But if you can think of a and existing or more simple solution, let me know!
