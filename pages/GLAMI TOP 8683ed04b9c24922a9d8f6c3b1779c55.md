**[Transformation](https://connection.keboola.com/admin/projects/1828/transformations-v2/keboola.snowflake-transformation/727206654)**

[**Report**](https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/Reviewsdashboard/Reviewsdashboard)

- [ ]  **Make provider filter work on all tables (optional)**

### a. Integration with shops - number of active partners*, number of newly connected partners, number of transactions

- active partners - all connected partners by OrderReview table
- newly connected - with at least 1 order in the selected period but not before
- all orders of these partners
- use data_provider_daily_snapshot

### b. Popup - number of views, number of clicks (agree, disagree), CTR of agree clicks

- we don’t register any other view event there apart from ‘shown’ which is already pretty much visible in the report

### c. Mailing - number of send emails, number of open emails, number of clicked links from emails

- [ ]  create mysql extracts for OrderReviewEmailUserFillReview for point c. *Mailing - number of send emails, number of open emails, number of clicked links from emails*

### e. Publication on Glami - number of all reviews, number of reviews on active products

- number of reviews on active products → blend review_item_option in the same report on data_provider_id. Item status is there, add it as a filter.
