Additional requirements:

-soft metrics

1. In this table I need official and unofficial together : [https://prnt.sc/uhmzuu](https://prnt.sc/uhmzuu) pretty, for me it is important the reporting for the channel as a whole
2. Also, would be possible to include in the channel next to WoW also pacing in a given month?
3. In brand traffic in the hover over box, I would appreciate to also YoY: [https://prnt.sc/uhn5ql](https://prnt.sc/uhn5ql)
4. Currency change to CZK would be highly appreciated
