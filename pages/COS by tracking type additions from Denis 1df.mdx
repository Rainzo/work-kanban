Hey, have another request for just update, we need somehow based on this report [https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/COSbytrackingtype/COSbytrackingtype?:iid=5](https://tableau.glami.info/#/views/COSbytrackingtype/COSbytrackingtype?:iid=5) (as we are saving history) to see:

1. Providers which had GA until date 12.01. lets say and last 2 days we are not receiving any GA data (connection lost) or somehow filter that shops
2. Based on that have some alerts > GA connection lost
